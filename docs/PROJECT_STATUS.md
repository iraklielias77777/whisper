# User Whisperer Platform - Project Status

## 📊 Current State Overview

**Last Updated**: December 15, 2024  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Architecture**: Microservices + AI Orchestration  
**Status**: 🟡 **Development Phase** (Phase 1 Cleanup Complete)

---

## ✅ **Phase 1 Cleanup - COMPLETED**

### What Was Fixed:
- ✅ **Removed duplicate services** - eliminated Go channel-orchestration in favor of TypeScript
- ✅ **Cleaned empty directories** - removed unused content-generator folder
- ✅ **Fixed dependency inconsistencies** - standardized shared library references
- ✅ **Corrected Node.js versions** - unified to Node.js 20+ across all services
- ✅ **Removed invalid dependencies** - cleaned Python packages from Node.js services
- ✅ **Organized documentation** - moved historical documents to docs/project-history/

### Critical Fixes Applied:
1. **Shared Library Integration**: All services now properly reference `"@userwhisperer/shared": "file:../../shared"`
2. **Node.js Consistency**: All services standardized to `"node": ">=20.0.0"`
3. **Invalid Package Removal**: Removed `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` from behavioral-analysis service
4. **Technology Stack Unification**: Committed to TypeScript/Node.js for all microservices

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture**

### **Active Services (All TypeScript/Node.js):**
- **🔄 event-ingestion** - High-throughput event processing
- **🧠 behavioral-analysis** - User behavior pattern detection  
- **⚡ decision-engine** - ML-powered intervention decisions
- **📝 content-generation** - LLM-powered personalization
- **📡 channel-orchestrator** - Multi-channel message delivery
- **🤖 ai-orchestration** - Master AI coordination layer

### **Shared Components:**
- **📚 shared/** - TypeScript utilities (database, Redis, logging, config)
- **🐍 shared/ai_orchestration/** - Python AI components  
- **🧮 shared/ml/** - Machine learning models and training pipelines
- **📋 shared/utils/** - Python data management utilities

### **Infrastructure Ready:**
- **🗄️ PostgreSQL Schema** - Complete with partitioning, GDPR compliance
- **🔧 Docker Compose** - Local development environment
- **📊 Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **🔒 Security Configs** - RBAC, network policies

---

## 🎯 **Next Phases (Recommended Priority)**

### **Phase 2: Service Implementation Completion**
- [ ] Complete missing utility classes in event-ingestion
- [ ] Implement proper service discovery mechanism
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Create Docker configurations for each service

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- [ ] End-to-end service integration testing
- [ ] API Gateway implementation (Kong)
- [ ] Message queue integration (Pub/Sub)
- [ ] Database migration execution

### **Phase 4: Production Readiness**
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests completion
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Load testing and performance optimization
- [ ] Security scanning and compliance verification
