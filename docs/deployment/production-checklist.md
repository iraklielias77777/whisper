## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Verify cluster status
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes

# 2. Check current deployments
kubectl get deployments -n user-whisperer-prod

# 3. Verify secrets and configmaps
kubectl get secrets -n user-whisperer-prod
kubectl get configmaps -n user-whisperer-prod

# 4. Check resource quotas
kubectl describe quota -n user-whisperer-prod
```

### Phase 2: Database Migration (if needed)
```bash
# 1. Backup current database
./scripts/backup.sh production

# 2. Test migration on staging
./scripts/migrate.sh staging

# 3. Run production migration
./scripts/migrate.sh production

# 4. Verify migration success
./scripts/verify-migration.sh production
```

### Phase 3: Application Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy with zero-downtime strategy
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force

# 2. Monitor deployment progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-gateway -n user-whisperer-prod
kubectl rollout status deployment/event-ingestion -n user-whisperer-prod

# 3. Verify pod health
kubectl get pods -n user-whisperer-prod
kubectl describe pods -n user-whisperer-prod
```

### Phase 4: Post-deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Run smoke tests
./scripts/smoke-test.sh production

# 2. Check service health
curl -f https://api.userwhisperer.ai/health

# 3. Verify monitoring
# - Check Grafana dashboards
# - Verify alert rules are active
# - Test notification channels

# 4. Performance validation
./scripts/performance-test.sh production
```
